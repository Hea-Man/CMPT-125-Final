Limitations

Known Bugs
----------

- So we think we have fixed this bug on our end and have tested it extensively but 
  just incase we have missed it somewhere. We want the TA marking this to know that 
  sometimes you might have to input your answer twice so that the resulting function
  / program runs ( Note : the program has all functionalities implemented and we don't
  want this bug to result in those not getting marked )


Extra Features
--------------

- We added additional fields in our supercar class. We also have an extensive
  class 

- We tried to make sure to address lots of cases of find and delete and those functions
  are implemented separately

- We used github to work on this project together. We learned github and then we
  used its various features to work on the project. The link to it is here:

Limitations
-----------

deleting by range has not been implemented

Known Bugs
----------

- There are a few times in which text may have to be entered twice. The code still
  works normally. We have attempted to fix this bug many times over but yet it still
  happens occasionally. If this happens, just enter what you wanted to enter again
  and it will continue to work.


Extra Features
--------------

- We added additional fields in our supercar class. We also have an extensive
  class 

- We tried to make sure to address lots of cases of find and delete and those functions
  are implemented separately

- We used github to work on this project together. We learned github and then we
  used its various features to work on the project. The link to it is here:
